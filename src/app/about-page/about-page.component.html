<div class="about">
  <p>Well, if you didn't figure it out already, my name is John Luetke. I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California" target="_blank">Sacramento</a> native who did a stint in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" target="_blank">Milwaukee</a> and now lives in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle" target="_blank">Seattle</a>. I'm a software engineer by trade, practicing the programming branch of the Computer Science &mdash; Software Engineering &mdash; which takes the theories and research of the traditional Computer Scientists and applies them to real-world computational and (mostly) business problems. I throughly enjoy writing code, but I also enjoy the architecture, design and lifecycle of software.</p>
  <p>I received my bachelor's degree in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="http://marquette.edu/" target="_blank">Marquette University</a> in 2010. After graduation, I accepted a job offer in the most technologically ept (and green) city in the US &mdash; Seattle. I've been living here ever since, and have been enjoying every day of it.</p>
  <p>In 2014, I decided to go back to school and work towards my masters degree. After some internal deliberation, I settled on the <a href="http://hcde.uw.edu" target="_blank">Human-Centered Design and Engineering</a> program at the <a href="https://uw.edu">University of Washington</a>. Writing software is a great skill to have, but it is even more important to understand and empathize with those who will be using the software you create, which is where the HCDE program comes in. Over the course of three years, I undertook and participated in no less that five projects which helped me both gain and refine the skills needed to be a human-centered designer. Some of these projects, but not all, due to varying reasons, are outlined in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
  <p>My job in Seattle is with <a href="http://libertymutual.com" target="_blank">Liberty Mutual Insurance</a>; I develop and support claims software for the auto and property lines of business. I've worked in Java and the miscellany of JVM languages, such as Scala and Groovy, C# and other .NET languages, Python and C++. I've even ventured into the one of ther primier languages of yesteryear: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" target="_blank">COBOL</a>.</p>
  <p>At Marquette, I worked for <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/communication/student-media.php">Student Media</a> as the Interactive Director &mdash; student worker in charge of the websites of every outlet of Student Media &mdash; and the <a href="http://mu.edu/orl">Office of Residence Life</a> as a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=resident+assistant">Resident Assistant</a>.</p>
