    "description": "<blockquote><p>How might we design natural and intuitive interactions between humans and robots?</p></blockquote><p>The idea to build SIM was conceived after my team and I observed struggles in different interaction patterns with robotics projects that we had been involved with. We concluded that existing interaction patterns were both unnatural and forced upon the user, and we sought to create a more natural experience, by applying the Human-Centered Design process.</p><p>The goal of SIM was to build a prototype robot that could engage in affective interactions by both understanding an expressing emotion. Expressions of emotion is a complex subject, involving a number of human factors, such a facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In order to keep ourselves on track, we decided to focus on facial expressions. We devised a behavioral model &mdash; aptly named the  <em>S</em>ocial <em>I</em>nteraction <em>M</em>odel &mdash; of antecedent conditions, facial emotions of the human, and &quot;goal&quot; states to define how SIM would react to an emotional stimulus in a given situation, and how that emotional response would affect the dynamics of that interaction. Our hope was for this model would create the illusion of &quot;social intelligence&quot; in the robot, creating a more desirable experience for the user.</p><div class='inline-image left'><img src='/assets/projects/sim-the-social-robot/113663ca.jpg' /><div class='caption'>Testing participant with SIM.</div></div><p>Our testing focus on a user building trust with SIM, and if a higher level of trust was achieved when the robot expressed social intelligence. Each testing session consisted of two rounds: one where the Social Interaction Model was enabled, and another where it was not. In each round, the user was asked SIM a set of questions with no true &quot;right&quot; answer, such as picking the dominant color in an image, and SIM would either agree or disagree with the user's answer. We observed how the SIM's response affected the user's behavior throughout the test, such as if the user changed thier original answer.</p><p>SIM has two major components: an Android smartphone that functions as a face, and a body made up of three Dynamixel AX-18A servo motors powered by a Raspberry Pi 3.</p><p>SIM uses the Android smartphone as its central processor. The screen acts as the robot’s face, while the camera is used to capture a live video of a user. Onboard emotional processing software analyzes the user’s facial expressions from this video and provides information about the user’s emotions. This information is then passed through a social interaction model which generates an appropriate response for the robot. The chosen response is composed of an animated facial expression that is rendered on the smartphone’s screen, and a message containing desired body movements that is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth.</p><p>The body’s servos are positioned in such a way that allows for 3 degrees of motion: one on the pitch axis and two on the yaw axis. The message from the smartphone contains instructions for each servo, resulting in a physical animation that corresponds with SIM’s facial expression.</p>",
